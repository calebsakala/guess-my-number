# Guess My Number
This little web game started as the product of me following along with The Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy (taught by Jonas Schmedtmann). 

It ended with me running *wild*.

Within: 
* index.html
* script.js
* style.css

The hosted page is available at: https://calebsakala.github.io/guess-my-number/
I do not own and did not alter the HTML file used within the webpage hosted above: all credit goes to the owner and creator: Jonas Schmedtmann.
